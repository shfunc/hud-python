This guide will get you up and running with the HUD SDK using a simple browser task and the OpenAI Operator Agent.

## 1. Prerequisites

*   **Python:** Ensure you have Python 3.10 or later installed.
*   **API Keys:** You'll need API keys for both HUD and the agent you want to use (e.g., OpenAI).

## 2. Installation

Install the HUD SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install hud-python
```

For more details, see the [Installation Guide](/installation).

## 3. API Key Setup

The SDK automatically loads API keys from environment variables or a `.env` file in your project root. Set the following:

*   `HUD_API_KEY`: Your key from [app.hud.so](https://app.hud.so).
*   `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (if using OperatorAgent).
*   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your Anthropic API key (if using ClaudeAgent).

Example `.env` file:
```
HUD_API_KEY=sk-hud-...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

## 4. Run Your First Agent

This example uses the `OperatorAgent` to interact with a browser environment. It defines a task, creates an environment, runs the agent, and evaluates the result.

```python
import asyncio
import os
from hud import gym, job                  # Import gym for environments and job decorator
from hud.task import Task                 # Import Task to define the goal
from hud.agent import OperatorAgent       # Import the agent
# hud.settings automatically loads keys from .env or environment variables

# Decorator to group this run under a job named "quickstart-run"
@job("quickstart-run")
async def main():
    # 1. Define a Task: What should the agent do?
    task = Task(
        prompt="Search for 'capybara' on Google",
        gym="hud-browser",               # Use a browser environment
        setup=("goto", "google.com"),    # Action to perform before the agent starts
        evaluate=("contains_text", "capybara") # How to check if the task succeeded
    )

    # 2. Create Environment: The runtime for the task
    print("Creating environment...")
    env = await gym.make(task)          # Creates the environment specified in the task

    # 3. Initialize Agent: Perform the task
    #    API keys are loaded automatically by hud.settings
    print("Initializing agent...")
    agent = OperatorAgent(environment="browser") # Specify environment type for the agent

    # 4. Interaction Loop: Agent observes and acts
    print("Starting interaction loop...")
    # Get initial observation (screenshot, text, etc.) by stepping without actions
    obs, _ = await env.reset()

    for i in range(5): # Limit to 5 steps for this example
        print(f"--- Step {i+1} ---")
        # Agent predicts the next action(s) based on the observation
        actions, done = await agent.predict(obs)
        print(f"Agent action(s): {actions}")

        # Execute the action(s) in the environment
        obs, reward, terminated, info = await env.step(actions)

        if done or terminated: break # Agent signaled task completion or environment terminated

    # 5. Evaluate & Close
    print("Evaluating task...")
    result = await env.evaluate()       # Run the evaluation defined in the Task
    print(f"Evaluation result: {result}")

    print("Closing environment...")
    await env.close()                   # Clean up environment resources

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Ensure API keys are set before running
    if not os.getenv("HUD_API_KEY") or not os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"):
        print("Error: Please set HUD_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY environment variables or in a .env file.")
    else:
        asyncio.run(main())

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Task:** Defines the goal (`prompt`), the type of environment (`gym`), initial setup steps (`setup`), and how success is measured (`evaluate`).
2.  **Environment:** `gym.make(task)` creates the specified browser environment instance.
3.  **Agent:** `OperatorAgent` is initialized. It automatically uses the `OPENAI_API_KEY` found by `hud.settings`.
4.  **Interaction Loop:**
    *   `env.step()` with no actions gets the initial observation.
    *   `agent.predict(obs)` gets the next action(s) from the agent.
    *   `env.step(actions)` executes the actions and gets the new observation.
5.  **Evaluation & Close:** `env.evaluate()` checks if the task succeeded based on the `evaluate` definition. `env.close()` shuts down the environment.
6.  **`@job` Decorator:** Wrapping `main` with `@job("quickstart-run")` automatically creates a Job. When `env.close()` is called, the recorded interactions (trajectory) are associated with this Job. You can view the job and its trajectory video on the [HUD Jobs page](https://app.hud.so/jobs).
