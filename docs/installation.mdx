# .env file
HUD_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |

## Development Installation

If you want to contribute to the SDK or install it in development mode:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/humanuniondata/hud-so.git
cd hud-so

# Create a virtual environment (using venv)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Or using uv (recommended)
uv venv
# Activate according to your shell

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Verification

To verify your installation, try running a simple example:

```python
import hud

# Print the version number
print(f"HUD-SO SDK version: {hud.__version__}")
```

You should see the version number of the installed SDK without any errors.
