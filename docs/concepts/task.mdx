# Tasks and TaskSets

Tasks define *what* an [Agent](/concepts/agent) should do in an [Environment](/concepts/environment), including the goal, initial setup steps, and how to evaluate success. [TaskSets](#taskset) are collections of related tasks.

## Task

A `Task` object provides the configuration for a specific scenario.

### Key Attributes

*   **`prompt` (str):** The primary instruction given to the agent.
*   **`gym` (str | `CustomGym` | None):** Specifies the type of [Environment](/concepts/environment) needed. Used by `hud.gym.make()`.
*   **`setup` (`HudStyleConfigs` | None):** Defines actions executed *before* the agent starts. See [Setup Configuration](#setup-configuration).
*   **`evaluate` (`HudStyleConfigs` | None):** Defines how to check if the agent succeeded *after* interaction. See [Evaluation Configuration](#evaluation-configuration).
*   **`id` (str | None):** Optional identifier.
*   **`metadata` (dict | None):** Optional dictionary for extra information.
*   **`config` (dict | None):** Optional dictionary, primarily for remote execution.

### Creating a Task

```python
from hud.task import Task

task = Task(
    prompt="Log in to example.com with username 'test'",
    gym="hud-browser", # Request a browser environment
    setup=[ # Actions run by gym.make(task)
        ("goto", "https://example.com/login")
    ],
    evaluate={ # Logic run by env.evaluate()
        "function": "page_contains", 
        "args": ["test"]
    }
)
```

### <a name="configuration-styles"></a>Configuration Styles (`setup` and `evaluate`)

Both `setup` and `evaluate` accept configurations defining function calls within the environment's controller, using flexible formats (`HudStyleConfigs`):

1.  **String:** `"browser.maximize"`
2.  **Tuple:** `("goto", "https://google.com")`
3.  **Dictionary:** `{"function": "wait_for_element", "args": ["#submit"]}`
4.  **List:** `[("goto", "page1"), ("click", "#next")]` (Executed sequentially)

### <a name="setup-configuration"></a>Setup Configuration (`setup`)

*   **Purpose:** Establishes a consistent starting state before the agent interacts.
*   **Execution:** Automatically run by `hud.gym.make(task)`. Can be run manually via `env._setup()`.
*   **Examples:** Navigating to a URL, logging in, preparing files.

### <a name="evaluation-configuration"></a>Evaluation Configuration (`evaluate`)

*   **Purpose:** Determines task success after the agent finishes.
*   **Execution:** Triggered by `await env.evaluate()`.
*   **Result:** The return value of `env.evaluate()`, often a reward score (e.g., `1.0` or `0.0`). This is stored in the `reward` field of the [Trajectory](/concepts/trajectory) if linked to a [Job](/concepts/job).
*   **Examples:**
    *   Interactive: `("contains_text", "Success!")`, `("file_exists", "/path/to/output.txt")`. These typically call functions *within* the active environment controller.
    *   QA: `("response_includes", "Paris")`. These functions often check the text stored in `env.final_response` (which comes from the agent's `ResponseAction`).
*   **Note:** Check specific environment or evaluation service documentation for available functions.

## TaskSet

A `TaskSet` is a list of related `Task` objects, useful for benchmarks.

### Key Attributes

*   **`tasks` (list[`Task`]):** The list of tasks.
*   **`id` (str | None):** Optional identifier.
*   **`description` (str | None):** Optional description.

### Loading a TaskSet

Load predefined sets from the HUD platform:

```python
from hud import load_taskset

taskset = await load_taskset("OSWorld-Ubuntu")
print(f"Number of tasks: {len(taskset)}") # TaskSet acts like a list
first_task = taskset[0]
```

Currently supported TaskSets available via `load_taskset` include OSWorld, GAIA, and WebVoyager subsets.

### Creating a TaskSet Manually

```python
from hud.task import Task
from hud.taskset import TaskSet

task1 = Task(...); task2 = Task(...)
my_taskset = TaskSet(tasks=[task1, task2], description="My set")
```

## Related Concepts

*   [Environment](/concepts/environment): Where Tasks are executed and evaluated.
*   [Agent](/concepts/agent): Aims to complete the Task `prompt`.
*   [Job](/concepts/job): Groups runs of different Tasks.
*   [Trajectory](/concepts/trajectory): Records the execution of a Task.

### Defining Question-Answering (QA) Tasks

While HUD excels at interactive tasks, you can also define tasks that are primarily question-answering. The key differences are:

*   **`gym`:** You might still use an existing environment type like `"hud-browser"` if you want the QA to happen *within* that context (e.g., asking the agent to answer based on a webpage). For pure QA without environment interaction, a future specific `"qa"` gym type might be introduced, but currently, you'd use an existing type.
*   **`prompt`:** Contains the question for the agent.
*   **`setup`:** Often minimal or unnecessary for pure QA.
*   **`evaluate`:** Defines how to check the agent's final text answer. This typically involves calling a specific evaluation function that compares the agent's final submitted response (see `ResponseAction` in [CLA Details](/advanced/cla-details)) against expected criteria. The `env.final_response` attribute holds the text submitted by the agent via `ResponseAction`.
*   **`target`:** (Recommended) Store the ground truth answer in the `metadata` or potentially a dedicated `target` field for clarity during evaluation function design.

```python
from hud.task import Task

qa_task = Task(
    prompt="What is the powerhouse of the cell?",
    gym="hud-browser", # Or potentially a future "qa" type
    # No complex setup needed for pure QA
    setup=(),
    # Evaluation checks the agent's final submitted text response
    evaluate=("response_includes", "mitochondria"), # Assumes a function checking env.final_response
)
```

The [Agent](/concepts/agent) handling such a task should recognize it doesn't need complex interaction and output a `ResponseAction` containing the final answer. The `env.evaluate()` call then triggers the specified check (like `response_includes`) against the stored response.
