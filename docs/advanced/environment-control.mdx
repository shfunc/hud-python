# Advanced Environment Control

While the standard `step`, `evaluate`, and `close` methods cover most interactions, the `Environment` object provides lower-level methods for more direct control, particularly useful for custom environments, debugging, and complex setup/evaluation scenarios.

## `invoke`

The `env._invoke_all()` method (and its underlying `client.invoke()`) is the core mechanism for calling specific functions *within* the environment's controller script.

```python
async def _invoke_all(self, configs: HudStyleConfigs) -> list[Any]: ...
```

*   **Purpose:** Execute custom functions defined in your environment controller (the Python code running inside the Docker container or remote instance). This is how `setup` and `evaluate` configurations in a `Task` are ultimately executed.
*   **Usage:** You provide a configuration (string, tuple, dict, or list) matching the `HudStyleConfigs` format. The SDK sends this to the environment controller, which runs the specified function(s) with the given arguments.
*   **When to Use:**
    *   Triggering custom evaluation logic not suitable for the standard `evaluate` attribute.
    *   Running specific diagnostic or state-setting functions within your custom environment controller during development or debugging.
    *   Implementing complex, multi-step setup or teardown procedures beyond what's easily defined in the `Task` `setup`.

```python
from hud.task import Task
from hud import gym

# Assume a custom environment controller has a function 'get_system_load()'
task = Task(prompt="Check system load", gym=...) # Using a CustomGym spec

env = await gym.make(task)

# Manually invoke the custom function
# Use the dictionary format for clarity
config = {"function": "get_system_load", "args": []}
results = await env._invoke_all(config)
system_load = results[0] # _invoke_all returns a list of results

print(f"Current system load: {system_load}")

await env.close()
```

## `execute`

The `client.execute()` method (accessible via `env.client.execute()` if `env.client` is a `DockerClient` subclass like `LocalDockerClient` or `RemoteDockerClient`) allows running arbitrary shell commands *inside* the environment container.

```python
# Assuming env.client is a LocalDockerClient or RemoteDockerClient
# Example: List files in the container's /tmp directory
result: ExecuteResult = await env.client.execute(
    command=["ls", "-la", "/tmp"],
    timeout=10 # Timeout in seconds
)

print("STDOUT:", result['stdout'].decode())
if result['stderr']:
    print("STDERR:", result['stderr'].decode())
print("Exit Code:", result['exit_code'])
```

*   **Purpose:** Directly interact with the environment's shell.
*   **Availability:** Primarily available for Docker-based environments (local or remote custom). Standard remote environments (like `"hud-browser"`) might not support arbitrary command execution via this method.
*   **When to Use:**
    *   **Debugging:** Checking file existence, process status, or network connectivity *inside* the container.
    *   **Complex Setup:** Running intricate setup scripts or commands that are difficult to express using the standard `setup` configuration.
    *   **Local Development:** Installing packages or modifying the container state interactively during development of a custom environment.
*   **Returns:** An `ExecuteResult` typed dictionary containing `stdout` (bytes), `stderr` (bytes), and `exit_code` (int).

## `_setup`

```python
async def _setup(self, config: HudStyleConfigs | None = None) -> None: ...
```

*   **Purpose:** Executes the setup configuration for the environment.
*   **Execution:** This is normally called *automatically* by `hud.gym.make(task)` if the provided `task` has a `setup` configuration.
*   **When to Use Manually:**
    *   **Debugging:** To re-run setup steps on an already created environment instance without recreating it entirely.
    *   **Custom Flow:** If you create an environment *without* an initial task (`env = await gym.make("gym-id")`) and later want to apply setup steps before starting agent interaction (though `env.reset(task=...)` might be more idiomatic).
    *   To override the task's default setup by passing a different `config`.

```python
# Example: Manually re-running setup (less common)
task = Task(prompt="...", gym="...", setup=("goto", "initial_page.com"))
env = await gym.make(task) # Initial setup runs here

# ... some interaction ...

print("Re-running setup...")
await env._setup() # Re-runs the setup defined in the task

# Or run different setup steps
await env._setup( ("goto", "another_page.com") )

await env.close()
```

These advanced methods provide deeper control when the standard `step`/`evaluate`/`close` cycle isn't sufficient. Use them carefully, especially `execute`, as direct shell access can make scenarios less reproducible if not managed properly.
