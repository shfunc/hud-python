"""Job: the platform receipt for one execution — there are no standalone traces.

The live execution atom remains :class:`hud.eval.Run`; a ``Job`` collects the
graded runs of one batch under one platform job id. Every trace reports under
a job: the scheduler's batch job, or the single-run job :func:`rollout`
registers when called bare.

Backend reporting contract:
- ``POST /trace/job/{job_id}/enter`` — register the batch job.
- ``POST /trace/{trace_id}/enter``   — a rollout started.
- ``POST /trace/{trace_id}/exit``    — a rollout finished (reward / success).

All three are best-effort no-ops without telemetry + an API key, so local runs
never depend on the platform.
