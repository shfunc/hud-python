"""Root test fixtures: isolate unit tests from developer settings.

Without this, any test that exercises ``Taskset.run`` (or other platform
reporting paths) makes real HTTP calls to the platform whenever the developer
has ``HUD_API_KEY`` configured — spamming the platform with fake jobs/traces
and stalling the suite on network retries. CI never catches it because CI has
no API key.
