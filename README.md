HUD is a platform for building RL environments for AI agents, across coding, browser, computer-use, and robotics. Define an environment, write tasks, and run them as evals and training across any model, at any scale.

To learn more, see the [documentation](https://docs.hud.ai) and [environment reference](https://docs.hud.ai/v6/reference/environment).

## Install

```bash
# Install the CLI (recommended)
uv tool install hud --python 3.12

# …or as a library
pip install hud
```

> Previously published as [`hud-python`](https://pypi.org/project/hud-python/). The import and CLI names are unchanged. If you have `hud-python` installed, migrate with `pip uninstall -y hud-python hud && pip install hud` (uninstalling both first avoids the two packages clobbering each other's files), and replace `hud-python` with `hud` in requirements files and CI configs.

Get your API key at [hud.ai/project/api-keys](https://hud.ai/project/api-keys) and set it:

```bash
hud set HUD_API_KEY=your-key-here
# or: export HUD_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

Then start from the coding environment, or choose another example environment:

```bash
hud init my-env
hud init my-desktop-env --template cua
hud init my-custom-env --template blank
```

## The protocol

HUD is **protocol-first**. An agent and an environment exchange just three things: a **manifest** (the environment's capabilities and tasks), **`tasks.start`** that returns the prompt, and **`tasks.grade`** that returns the reward. In between, the agent just *works*, driving the capabilities itself. HUD owns only that thin envelope, so any model or harness plugs into any environment.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent
    participant Env as Environment
    participant Caps as Capabilities (ssh · mcp · cdp · rfb · robot)
    Note over Env,Caps: environment holds & serves these
    Agent->>Env: hello
    Env-->>Agent: manifest (capabilities)
    Agent->>Env: tasks.start
    Env-->>Agent: prompt
    rect rgb(238,238,238)
    Note over Agent,Caps: the agent works, driving capabilities directly
    Agent->>Caps: shell · browser · GUI · tools · robot
    Caps-->>Agent: observations
    end
    Agent->>Env: tasks.grade
    Env-->>Agent: reward
```

Because the protocol only exposes **capabilities** (never a fixed agent), an environment outlives any single harness: new harnesses and models keep running against the same environments, benchmarks, and tasks.

## Package & run anywhere

A built image is the **end product for your tasks**: one build packs every task from a single definition. The recommended path is **`hud deploy`**, which builds and registers your environment on HUD in one step; then sync a taskset and run remotely:

```bash
hud deploy
hud sync tasks my-taskset
hud eval my-taskset --remote
```

→ [Run & deploy](https://docs.hud.ai/v6/reference/runtime)

## Environments & templates

A **template** is an async generator registered with `@env.template()`: `yield` a prompt, receive the agent's answer, `yield` a reward. Calling the template mints a runnable **Task**; one function spans a whole dataset of variants. The simplest needs no capabilities — just a prompt and a grader:

```python
from hud import Environment

env = Environment(name="letter-count")


@env.template()
async def count_letter(word: str = "strawberry", letter: str = "r"):
    answer = yield f"How many '{letter}'s are in '{word}'? Reply with just the number."
    yield 1.0 if answer and str(word.count(letter)) in answer else 0.0


tasks = [count_letter(word=w) for w in ("strawberry", "raspberry", "blueberry")]
```

Run it immediately against any model:

```bash
hud eval tasks.py claude --group 3
```

Each graded evaluation is a **trace** (the SDK's live handle is a `Run`). With `HUD_API_KEY` set, every rollout is recorded on [hud.ai](https://hud.ai). Tasks that need a shell, browser, GUI, or robot declare **capabilities** (below); everything else — variants, grading, batching — stays identical.

## Existing benchmarks

The experimental `hud.integrations.harbor` adapter turns Harbor task directories into runnable HUD
tasksets and can export authored HUD tasks back to Harbor folders.

```python
from hud.integrations import harbor

taskset = await harbor.adapt("./benchmark")
```

→ [Harbor interop](https://docs.hud.ai/v6/advanced/harbor-convert)

## Capabilities & harnesses

A **capability** is a connection the environment exposes; a **harness** attaches its own tools to it. The same environment serves a one-shot Q&A or a full computer-use rollout, depending on which capabilities the harness opens.

| Protocol | What it exposes |
|----------|-----------------|
| **`ssh`** | Shell + files in a sandboxed workspace (`env.workspace(root)`) |
| **`mcp`** | Tools over the Model Context Protocol |
| **`cdp`** | Browser control over the Chrome DevTools Protocol |
| **`rfb`** | Full computer-use over VNC: screen + keyboard/mouse |
| **`robot`** *(beta)* | Schema-driven robot observation/action loop over WebSocket |

**Ships natively:** Claude, OpenAI (Responses), OpenAI-compatible endpoints, and Gemini via `create_agent("claude-sonnet-4-5")` (or `gpt-…`, `gemini-…`). The harness wires capability-backed tools for the model you choose at run time.

**Bring your own:** a harness attaches to a capability and defines a tool spec — wrap `browser-use` on `cdp`, a VLA policy on `robot`, or your own agent on `ssh` / `mcp`. No protocol work required.

→ [Capabilities](https://docs.hud.ai/v6/reference/capabilities) · [Models](https://docs.hud.ai/v6/reference/agents) · [Robots](https://docs.hud.ai/v6/advanced/robots)

## Deploy on the platform

From the [platform UI](https://hud.ai) you can run batches, compare models on the same taskset, and inspect every trace.

→ [Run & deploy](https://docs.hud.ai/v6/reference/runtime)

## Train on rewards

Every rollout returns a `Run` carrying a `trace_id` and a `reward`, so the tasks you evaluate are already training data. Run a **group** per task and pass the graded runs to `TrainingClient.step()`:

```python
from hud import TrainingClient
from hud.agents import create_agent
from hud.eval import Job

agent = create_agent("arith-rl", completion_kwargs={"extra_body": {"return_token_ids": True}})
trainer = TrainingClient("arith-rl")
taskset, runtime = ...  # your Taskset and where rollouts run

session = await Job.start("arith-rl", group=8)
start = len(session.runs)
await taskset.run(agent, runtime=runtime, group=8, job=session)
await trainer.step(session.runs[start:], learning_rate=1e-5, group_size=8)
```

HUD is the environment-and-reward source for your own GRPO/PPO loop — the same environment trains any model, text or multimodal, unchanged.
